Sure some things maybe blatantly better than other works, but it ultimately lies with the individual.

      "|NightlyReaper     |In Mechwarrior Online, I have begun to use a mouse for the \"turret\" aspect of the torso twist/tilt and a Logitech G13 for other controls (  The G-13 has a little thumbstick that works well for WASD functions and has a little keyboard to cover all the other (limited) controls required for MWO.  For modern games, I guess that's as close to HOTAS as they want you to get.  For a better solution, I think that with a joystick emulating mouse inputs it would be passable, but as you said:  It's presently a sad day and you have to be able to edit XML files to modify joystick input triggers and it starts becoming an occupation rather than a gaming hobby.  In Mechwarrior 2, 3, & 4 I use the Steel Battalion controller and it is freaking awesome to have the three axes of torso twist, tilt, walking direction, plus a real throttle, plus real hat switches for views, plus pedals for extra speed, stopping power and jumpjet control.  Not to mention the 32 other buttons and the flip cover over the eject button.

      "|NuffZetPand0ra    |You are talking about the Charsi imbue, right? Or a cube upgrade?\\nIf we are talking Charsi imbue, you can only imbue WHITE items. This includes superior, but they will not neccesarily be superior after imbuing (they get random base-modifications). Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques (gold), and therefore not eligible for imbuing.\\nWhen you imbue, the item level matters (the item level is hidden). The item is the same level as the monster who dropped it. That means, that the higher level the monster who dropped it, the more stats is available on that item. It is important to note that an item doesn't neccesarily use all it's stat potential. This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes.\\nAfter the imbue, the item can be as good as if the monster itself had dropped a rare (yellow) item. Imbued weapons will always turn out as rare items.\\nTo answer your question, you should just progress like you are now, fighting the hardest monsters you can. When a potential good white item appears, try to imbue that. Class specifiq items has a better chance to give +skills to your class. Circlets has the higest bonuses regarding yellow items. And you can get an extra base stat advantage by using exceoptional (nightmare) items, which will drop in a4-5 from time to time. You can check out monster levels, and item qualities (normal, exceptional, elite) on arreat summit ofc. :) \\n EDIT (forgot infoz):\\nIn cases of imbue-eligible items with base bonuses (maces, wands, staffs and class specifique items, and any other item with +skills etc.) will loose their current bonuses due to the base item reroll. They can get extra skills from the base item AND the rarity class. Say, if you imbue a staff with +1 fireball, it will reroll that base staff. It might turn out with a staff with +1 icebolt and +1 warmth, and then you add the bonuses the rarity would give you, lets say +1 icebolt and +1 fireball. Then your +1 fireball staff will have turned into a +2 icebolt +1 fireball staff. It might as well turn into any other staff allowed by it's item lvl though. \\n As far as I recall, weapon damage and defense values are not rerolled. I am not 100% positive on this though. Haven't played d2 for a looong time :P \\n TLDR: Class only items dropped from high-lvl monsters. \\n|positive |\n",

      "|nobodysdiary      |I could give a shit about turn by turn directions because I never drive and the new maps doesn't have ANY public transportation directions which is just complete bullshit -- especially for a company that is supposedly \"green\" conscious. \\n I know Apple and others have said that you can just get a 3rd party app, but to be honest I haven't found one for NYC Metro area that is as fast and complete as iOS5 Maps. It has integrated bus routes/schedules and train schedules and as someone else pointed out in another thread about this subject, you will need another 3rd party app if you go to a city other than your own, instead of easily being able to get directions as you travel. \\n I would also argue that since NYC of all places has a pretty shitty selection of 3rd party options, that the available options in other smaller major cities would be significantly shittier. \\n TL;DR  - I don't drive like  most  people in major cities, and need public transit directions integrated in iOS6 Maps. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |neutral  |\n",

      "|gadzookfilms      |I love this idea and most definitely want to help. I have a few concerns though. My primary concern is that of financing. Making movies isn't free as we all know. It's fine to work on one or two volunteer projects for fun and to build interest and community but somewhere down the line it must be made sustainable. Otherwise the turnover rate of artists skyrockets. \\n My secondary concern is keeping this as open, transparent, and democratic as possible.

Usually is at the end of summer and before rainy season. It's actually pretty close to Shaver lake. Lake Kaweah in CA. I don't remember the story well but they either made the lake or made it bigger and the town had to be moved. didnt take down the buildings and once in a while you can see them sticking up a bit out of the water. I think the area use to just be a river. a decent part of the Central Valley use to be a lake because of all of the rivers flowing in. Shaver might be from this too. blocking off the rivers to dry up the valley. Not sure though. \\n this is what it use to be. Tulare Lake. Biggest lake on the west side of the Mississippi river. Now the valley is dried up but has some of the best soil for crops in the world. \\n TL;DR: I'll try and get some similar shots from lake Kaweah next time I'm up there because there is an entire small town under the lake. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |neutral  |\n",
